# Attendance
Attendance taking application. Major features include, adding new students, taking attendance and checking old record of students. Still in progress. Only made this to practice MVVM architecture. Too much boilerplate code. Too many bad practices. Feel free to let me know if they can improved.
AddStudent fragment is for adding new student.
Attendance fragment is for taking attendance. It is also the home fragment in navigation graph.
OldRecords fragment shows old attendance Records.
